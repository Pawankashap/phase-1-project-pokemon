# Introduction
The Pokemon App is a good way to find your favorite Pokemon, and you can also save your favorites. The Pokemon App allows you to modify and delete Pokemon in your record. Itâ€™s helpful to make a list of your favorite Pokemon so you can see their details. The Pokemon App finds Pokemon's details on the external API and saves them in a local database file. I used Pokemon Banner image form https://wallpaperaccess.com/pokemon-hd website.

# Contributing
  I contributed to this project. I have some requirements, like searching for items in the external API and inserting them into the internal API using JSON Server. It's a single page web application, and it works without page reload. I used two distinct event listners, for example, Click Evernt Listner and Change Event Lister. I used the forEach method to implement array iteration.
